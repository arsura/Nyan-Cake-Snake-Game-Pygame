# Nyan Cat (Snake Game)
Computer Programming Project - 1st Year Semester 2, 2015. <br/>
This game made with Python, [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) and [Pytest Framework](https://doc.pytest.org/) for scenario test. For example out of bound, crashing some objects. I learned about pygame and snakegame from 
[thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbPGzawDH1njbqV-D5HqKw) channel on Youtube and applied his code for making this game.
